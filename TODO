TODOs for the Nsm66d application and Nsm66 library

2025-01-29 to 2025-04-15

This file lists only the high-priority features and fixtures we need
to do for Nsm66d.

Features:

    -   Add a "--restart name" to send stop and resume actions with
        a delay (2 seconds) in between.
    -   Consider a vector<osc::tag> to perform multiple actions.

Tests:

    -   nsmd66 is not showing the "Got announce" messages.
    -   Run nsmctl with --nsmd-path build in one terminal window, and
        nsmctl --lookup in another under the debugger to see what is going
        wrong.
    -   How to keep Seq66 up-to-date when ports are added back in a
        session.
    -   Seq66 maybe be delaying responding/announcing to NSM.
    -   When creating a session, make sure playlist is copied if active.
    -   Do not error on missing input bus "ALSA Announce".
    -   See the Recording items below (*).
    -   The selection box vertical snap is too large; also needs
        to be more accurate/precise.
    -   Make the NSM start-up prompt time configurable or dependent on
        the number of words.
    -   Everytime Edit / Preferences is opened/closed, "[seq66] NSM URL..."
        is written to the console.
