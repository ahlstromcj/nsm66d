2025-01-29 to 2025-02-03

The "subprojects" directory shall support usage of the potext and
cfg66 libraries. plus the lib66 headers-only library, as subprojects
that get downloaded from GitHub.

Note that we might be able to just include nsm66 as a subject, 
as that library already has the other wraps as subprojects.
